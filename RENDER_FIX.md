# ðŸ”§ Fix Render Deployment Error

## Error Message:
```
Service Root Directory "/opt/render/project/src/bull-backend" is missing.
builder.sh: line 51: cd: /opt/render/project/src/bull-backend: No such file or directory
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix:

### In Render Dashboard, Update Settings:

1. Go to your service settings in Render
2. Look for **"Root Directory"** field
3. Change it to: `.` (just a dot)
4. Save settings
5. Click **"Manual Deploy"** â†’ **"Clear build cache & deploy"**

### Alternative: If Root Directory Field Doesn't Exist

1. Delete your current service in Render
2. Create a new service
3. When configuring:
   - **Source**: Connect to `parrot-sketch/bull-backend`
   - **Root Directory**: Leave EMPTY or enter `.`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build && npm run db:migrate:deploy`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run start:prod`

## Why This Happened:

Your repository `bull-backend` IS the backend code (not a monorepo with a subdirectory).

Render was looking for a subdirectory that doesn't exist.

## âœ… Correct Configuration:

- **Root Directory**: `.` (current directory)
- OR leave Root Directory field empty
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build && npm run db:migrate:deploy`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start:prod`

## ðŸš€ After the Fix:

1. Deployment should complete in 3-5 minutes
2. Check logs for: "Build successful"
3. Your API will be live at: `https://bull-backend.onrender.com`

**Note**: I pushed an updated `render.yaml` with `rootDir: .` but you need to update the Render dashboard settings too!
